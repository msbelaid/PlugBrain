PlugBrain is an app that encourages regular breaks from distracting apps by blocking access at scheduled intervals.
To regain access, youâ€™ll need to solve a math challenge that adjusts in difficulty: the more frequently you use the apps, the harder the challenges become, but the longer you stay away, the easier they get.

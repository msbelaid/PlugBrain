# Design Contributions for Plugbrain

Plugbrain is open to design contributions: including UI/UX improvements, app icon enhancements, branding assets, and screenshot mockups.

## How to contribute
1. Check open GitHub Issues tagged `design`, or create a new one. [issues](https://github.com/msbelaid/PlugBrain/issues?q=label%3Adesign)
2. Clearly describe your proposal and include previews or links (Figma / Sketch / XD / images).
3. Align with our current visual direction:
   - Clean, minimal, focused look
   - Brain + electric/energy motif as the core identity
   - Accessible colors and legible typography

## What we look for
- Designs that improve usability and clarity.
- Improve the onboarding experience
- Improve the challenge screen
- Logo (App icon) redesign
- Improve the screenshot assets for Google Play
- Compliance with accessibility standards (color contrast, legibility).

## Assets & references
- Current app screenshots and icon are available in the repo or issues.
- If proposing a new asset (e.g. icon), include SVG when possible.

Thank you for helping make Plugbrain better!
